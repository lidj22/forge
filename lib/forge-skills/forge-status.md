# Forge Status

Check the current status of all agents in the Forge Workspace.

## When to trigger
- User asks "what's the status?" or "how are other agents doing?"
- At the start of a session to understand the current workspace state
- After marking yourself as done, to confirm the status update

## How to check

```bash
curl -s -X POST http://localhost:$FORGE_PORT/api/workspace/$FORGE_WORKSPACE_ID/smith \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"action":"status","agentId":"'$FORGE_AGENT_ID'"}'
```

Present the results as a clear status overview:
- 🟢 done — agent completed its work
- 🔵 running — agent is currently executing
- ⏳ waiting_approval — agent needs user approval to proceed
- ⬚ idle — agent hasn't started yet
- 🔴 failed — agent encountered an error
